## Troubleshooting

### Analytics not showing?

- **Check deployment** - Make sure you're deployed to Vercel
- **Verify component** - Ensure `<Analytics />` is in your layout

### No data in dashboard?

- **Check project** - Make sure you're viewing the correct project
- **Wait for traffic** - Analytics only shows data when there's traffic
